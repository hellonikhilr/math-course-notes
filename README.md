1. These are some notes from my time as an undergraduate student. Proceed with caution for errors.
2. The purpose of these notes was to help me internalize information and study for my courses, not to publish; as such, I have tried to strike a balance between thoroughness and conciseness. 
3. They were originally written down in Markdown where LaTeX was used strictly for math notation. Since then, I either used an LLM or Python script to handle the conversion into full LaTeX documents. 
4. As it is still more convenient for me to access these files in Markdown on my local machine on a daily basis, I will not be frequently updating the LaTeX files, unless there is a major addendum or erratum.
5. New files will be uploaded periodically as I produce more notes. 
6. All rights reserved. I of course would like to thank my professors, who continually fueled my interest for mathematics and helped me greatly to learn this material; while these notes are obviously derived from some of their lectures, I ultimately compiled them in my own words. As such, I would not like them to be redistributed in anyway.
7. Happy reading!
