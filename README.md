## Overview
This repository contains synthesized lecture notes for a selection of advanced undergraduate courses in mathematics and physics. The goal of this project was to translate my original notes into a more sophisticated format, in particular LaTe​X documents suitable for reference.

## Original Format
These notes were originally produced in a Markdown environment (namely, Obsidian) for ease of access (across various platforms such as my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook) and convenient editing. LaTeX was used strictly for mathematical symbols and notation, which is supported with Markdown.

My goal in making these notes was to synthesize my knowledge and understanding of the material I was learning, with a focus on structural clarity, consistent notation, and logical flow. I tried to strike a balance between thoroughness and conciseness. These notes were also meant to be used to study for future material, and as a refresher of prerequisites for when I was taking more advanced courses.

## Conversion and Release Cycle
To convert my notes into the LaTeX format uploaded to this repository, I utilized Python scripts and LLM assistance to translate my Markdown documents into LaTeX. The PDF documents in this repository represent "stable releases" of the material. Since the source files are maintained in Obsidian for daily use across multiple platforms, these PDFs are updated periodically to reflect major addenda or errata. New course notes will be uploaded as they reach maturity.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the professors who delivered the original lectures upon which these notes are based. Their expertise, clarity, and dedication to teaching were instrumental in my understanding of these subjects and provided the essential foundation for this work.

## Disclaimer
Please note that while the content closely follows the lectures delivered by my professors, the structure and phrasing reflect my own conceptualization of the material. I have made several modifications to the original curriculum, such as including proofs I investigated independently that were not covered in class, or omitting and re-ordering sections based on my background from other courses.

These notes are a synthesis of my personal understanding derived from university lectures. While every effort has been made to ensure mathematical accuracy, they are ultimately intended as a student reference and may contain errors.
